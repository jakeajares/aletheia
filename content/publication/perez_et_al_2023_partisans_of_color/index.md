abstract: "What influences partisan allegiance among Asian Americans and Latinos? These fast-growing demographics are heavily populated by immigrants who were raised outside the U.S., which limits *parental socialization* as the primary mechanism behind their partisan identities. We argue that contemporary Asian and Latino partisanship is shaped by two systemic forces: racialization and polarization. Asian and Latino adults regularly navigate the straits between their *racial* and *American* identities—two categories, sorted along partisan lines, that shape their sense of belonging in the U.S. We hypothesize that Asian and Latino adults generally prioritize their *racial* or *national* identity, which affects their intensity of identification as Democrats or Republicans. Leveraging major Asian and Latino surveys since 2006 (N=20,327), we uncover wide heterogeneity in identity prioritization, with 27% of Asian and Latino adults privileging their *American* identity over their *racial* one. Moreover, greater prioritization of one’s *racial* (versus *national*) identity is significantly associated with Democratic (versus Republican) allegiance (meta-analyzed *d*~.30). These patterns also emerge at an automatic level via Implicit Association Tests (IATs). Across two experiments (N=2,920) we then isolate one possible mechanism: Asian and Latino adults who feel their prioritized identity is overlooked signal their preferred attachment through their partisan allegiance."
