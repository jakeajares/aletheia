<<<<<<< HEAD
Aletheia is a platform for disseminating research that seeks to rethink how we communicate the discovery of knowledge. Unlike a peer-reviewed journal, there is no gatekeeping---all research is transparently communicated. Unlike a preprint repository, research undergoes peer review. The core values of Aletheia are transparency, opennness, and the search for truth via the exchange of ideas.
